# Python Alarm Clock
Alarm clock using python programming language. 

# Objective
The objective of this project is to build a alarm clock using python libraries such as datetime, which will take user input (Time to set alarm) and plays a tone when the input time matches the current time.

# main body
First we import some libraries like:
1. playsonund
2. datetime

Than take a time input from the user (time to set alarm) in 12 hour format like HH:MM:SS:AM/PM

Now assign the user time to some variables, like for hour, minutes, second, and AM or PM.

Using a while loop, which will run until the current time matches the user input time and when it does, the program will play the selected sound using playsound function. And break the loop. 

# Output
The program will plays a sound whem the current time matches the user input time and stops automatically when the sound gets ended.
